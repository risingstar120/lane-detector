# Lane Detection with Steer Assist and Lane Departure Monitoring

## Project Description & Objective
This project was created to demosntrate how a lane detection system works on cars equipped with a front facing camera.
Finding a place in more and more vehicles, this system is an essential part of the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) used in
autonomous / semi-autonomous vehicles. This feature is responsible for detecting lanes, measuring curve radius (tightness of a curve) and 
monitors if the vehicle is drifting away from its current lane and warns the driver to prevent unwanted traffic incidents. With this 
information, this system significantly improves safety by making sure the vehicle is where it's supposed to be, as well as, comfort if it
is also configured to control steering wheel to take gentle curves on highways.
