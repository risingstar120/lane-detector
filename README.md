# Lane Detection with Steer Assist and Lane Departure Monitoring

## Project Description & Objective
This project was created to demonstrate how a lane detection system works on cars equipped with a front facing camera.
Finding a place in more and more vehicles, this system is an essential part of the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) used in
autonomous / semi-autonomous vehicles. This feature is responsible for detecting lanes, measuring curve radius (tightness of a curve) and 
monitors if the vehicle is drifting away from its current lane and warns the driver to prevent unwanted traffic incidents. With this 
information, this system significantly improves safety by making sure the vehicle is centered inside the lane lines, as well as adds comfort if it is also configured to control steering wheel to take gentle curves on highways without any driver input. This version here is a simplified version and best functions if good conditions are provided (clear lane lines, stable light conditions). In this repository, it is included a video of a dash cam for the script to work with.
